It all gave them a sense of joy they had never felt before, some form of malformed, maniacal joy. Most people could never understand. The story starts 3 long, long months ago - their next target was scouted and plans were made. They would carry the attack out soon. Very soon.";

They were skilled at what they did, the best in the world, and they ensured there was no evidence left behind. How? Dynamite, Lot's and lots of dynamite - which conveniently - they had in abundance. Everything was almost ready and the team was prepared. Very, very prepared. This heist was their biggest yet and with all their planning, it would not fail, it could not fail.";

So, as night fell, they all got on their bikes, engines on - and rode towards the bank, silence between the team. Their biggest score ever was about to begin.

They had barely been in the bank 30 seconds and they had almost filled all of their bags, gold, cash and jewels were taken. Anything they could grab, they did and stuffed it into their pockets. It was only a matter of time before the police arrived. They needed to be quick, and quick they were.";

The team strolled out the same way the entered. 6. 5. 4. They got on their bikes again, turned on their engines, making jokes and laughing all the way. 3. 2. 1. Engines revving, they rode off into the night, some even daring to pull a wheelie or two on their escape. BANG! The job was done, the bank had fallen, soon the entire system would too. Paper money was a thing of the past. The MotoRobbers are here to prove it.";
